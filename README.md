## Introduction

This is an html application that integrates some javascript and css coding into the application makeup. The application is simple in nature with only a functioning hair types anad homepage.  There are only html pages that are linked within the website that make the application move to another page.  However, these pages are blank and only contain the background color of the website. .

## Page Overview 
Pages homepage.cshtml and HairTypes.html are the only pages that are function at the time of push (02/06/2024).  The homepage breaks down the different hairtypes and weather conditions that the application is currently exploring.  This table includes navigation to the other pages even though they are currently not operational.  The HairTypes.cshtml pages using a hero image setting to break down the three different kind of hair types that we are currently looking at.  The navigation buttons move the user to www.weather.com currently until more weather data and models are available to the user.  

## Improvements
Application development on both the front end and back end of the website to be function for the user. 
Needed weather data to be able to make the website more functional 
Machine-learning adaptation for the user to be able to interact with the website to create a lookbook 
Application data to move to mobile development 

## Installation
Users can use the code provided within the github repository to use in a starter code in an IDE.  This code is simplistic in nature and would be a great starting point for a weather application that needs front and back end development.  

## Contributing

ChatGPT was referenced to find errors in code throughout the development process.  The prompts were “Fix this code to not run with errors” followed by the code 
ChatGPT was also referenced to gain more knowledge about what should be in a readme. The prompt was “what should be put in a readme” and “readme template” 

## Conclusion 
The Weather Application is written in html with add ins of css and javascript.  The application is very simplistic and was written for a MIST class at WVU.  This application serves for learning purposes and classroom development during the semester.  This application, if were to move forward, would need more development on both the front end and the back end of the application to be able to be function for the users input and output.
